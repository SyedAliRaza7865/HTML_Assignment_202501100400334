A simple travel website made with HTML5 as part of a web development assignment given by my faculty @MAYANK_LAKHOTIA SIR.
It includes a homepage with headings and a travel essentials section. I used all the tags, links, images and tables etc taught by MAYANK SIR till now.
Files: index.html (main page) and Contact_Us file with images which I've used in my website.
